            <h3>Starting PSQL</h3>
            I had to jump through a few hidden hoops to get PSQL up
            and running on my Ubuntu WSL. Most sources will insist that Postgres
            is already installed on Ubuntu but this proved not to be the case for me.
            Instead I got the most recent package (Version 13 as of writing):
            <code>
                apt-get install postgresql-13
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Starting your Server
            </h3>
            I had to start my server cluster??
            <code>
                sudo pg_ctlcluster 13 main start
            </code>
            You can check if your server is running with
            <code>
                service postgresql status
            </code>
        </p>
        <code>
