            <h3>Starting PSQL</h3>
            I had to jump through a few hidden hoops to get PSQL up
            and running on my Ubuntu WSL. Most sources will insist that Postgres
            is already installed on Ubuntu but this proved not to be the case for me.
            Instead I got the most recent package (Version 13 as of writing):
            <code>
                apt-get install postgresql-13
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Starting your Server
            </h3>
            I had to start my server cluster??
            <code>
                sudo pg_ctlcluster 13 main start
            </code>
            You can check if your server is running with
            <code>
                service postgresql status
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Opening PSQL
            </h3>
            Setting up Postgresql will create a new 'postgres' user. Switch 
            to that user by running:
            <code>
                su postgres
            </code>
            Now you're operating as your 'postgres' user and can run postgres.
            <code>
                psql
            </code>
            If you have a database already set up you can open right to it:
            <code>
                psql my_database_name
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Creating & Removing Databases
            </h3>
            Create a database using 'createdb' and give it a name:
            <code>
                createdb new_database_name
            </code>
            To remove it you can use 'dropdb':
            <code>
                dropdb my_database_name
            </code>
            'Create' and 'Drop' are keywords to recognize throughout PSQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Creating & Removing Tables
            </h3>
            Now that you have a database it's time to make some tables to store your data in.
            Open it using:
            <code>
                \c my_database_name
            </code>
            Here's where we start getting into PSQL commands - as a best practice they're written all caps. You'll use 'CREATE TABLE' to make them, but you'll need to add parameters.
            <code>
                CREATE TABLE first_table (
            </code>
            End that first line with an open paranthesis - PSQL won't run anything until you end with a semicolon.
            <code>
                first_column text,
            </code>
            Columns are made up of two items: column name and data type.
            <code>
                second_column integer
            </code>
            Then close it out.
            <code>
                );
            </code>
            Just like databases, if you want to remove a table, you DROP it.
            <code>
                DROP TABLE first_table;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Adding Data to Your Tables
            </h3>
            Now you can start adding your data! We'll go over the simple manual process.
            'INSERT INTO' is our keyword for inserting data into a table.
            <code>
                INSERT INTO first_table VALUES ('Text goes here', 0);
            </code>
            The 'VALUES' keyword specifies what exactly we're inserting. You have to enter
            exactly what the table is expecting, so in our case we need something for first_column that is text
            and second_column that is an integer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Updating Data
            </h3>
            Sometimes you add columns after you've started to put data in. To update an existing table use ALTER TABLE.
            To add a new column:
            <code>
                ALTER TABLE first_table ADD COLUMN name text;
            </code>
            To update an existing row for this new column, you'll have to be specific and tell PSQL exactly which row you want to change.
            <code>
                UPDATE first_table SET name = 'Okoye' WHERE second_value = 0;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Queries - How to see your data
            </h3>
            You can run a Query on your table to see how your data is going in.
            <code>
                SELECT * FROM first_table;
            </code>
